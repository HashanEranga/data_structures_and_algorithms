Note :
    short coding is ideal in competitive programming. because the programme 
    written as fast as possible, 
    name long long is long it can be shorter as follows.

    typedef long long ll;

    ex:
        long long a = 123454567;
        long long b = 123456789;
        cout << a+b << endl;

        can be shorten as following 

        ll a = 1234556789;
        ll b = 9876543211;

        cout << a+b << endl;

        typedef also use as follows for complex stuff
        typedef vector<int> vi;
        typedef pait<int, int> pi;
